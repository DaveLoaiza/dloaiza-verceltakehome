        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have 18+ years of experience in customer facing technical roles. 
            I'm passionate about building long term partnerships with customers to solve technical challenges that have bottom line business impact.
            I love digging into hands-on technical problem solving, and enjoy the exposure to the wide range of businesses, industries, and unique challenges that working in customer success provides.
            I'm intellectually curious, and generally pretty easygoing and laid back. In my spare time, I'm a fan of Duke basketball, I support Arsenal Football Club, and I like to cook. 
            I read a good deal, and I'm currently going through a medieval history phase. Before that I was very into nautical/maritime novels, especially Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series.
            I used to play golf, but since having my second kid last August, I'm not sure if I do that anymore.
            I guess now that spring is here, I'll find out.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Most recently I worked at Lightstep, a developer observability SaaS tool that focused on distributed tracing. I joined as an IC, and most recently led a team of Technical Account Managers.
            We were acquired by ServiceNow in 2021. Our team was very technically hands-on and in the weeds with our customers. We also owned renewal and expansion outcomes, and managed the entire customer contract lifecycle after the close of the initial deal.
            Before Lightstep, I worked more in a professional services capacity, including a stint delivering Splunk proserv, working at an investment management software company, and doing general tech implementations in the legal industry.
            Technically I would say I'm a jack of all trades, which means I am great at quickly learning new technologies and troubleshooting. You can find more detail on my professional background
